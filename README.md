# libpng

## Prerequisite
* Have an internet connection
* Launch docker toolbox on windows


## How it works
To run the script just lunch 'run_docker.bat'
A picture_modified.png file should be created 

To modify your own png file, just replace the file named 'picture.png' with yours (renamed 'picture.png') before running 'run_docker.bat'.
